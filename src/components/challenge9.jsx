// React Context provides the ability to create data and pass this data via a provider to any component in a React application. Context in React allows you to pass data to any component without "prop drilling".

// # The Challenge: Use React Context
// You are required to create user data containing name and location in context, pass this data to two individual components, and update the data from a separate component.

// The requirements for this challenge are:

// Create a React context with name and location data
// Wrap parent component with context.
// Retrieve data in differ components.
// Update data in a different component.

import React from "react";
import Name from "./Name";
import Location from "./Location";
import UserForm from "./UserForm";
import "./ch9.css";
